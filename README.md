# tts-mercurial

Tabletop Simulator scripting for the beta implementation of Mercurial.

TODO:
  - Auto place Arcanas in player area.
  - More robust player checks in drop area, avoid player mistakes.

IDEAS:
  - Spell power tracking.  Could be an interesting algorithm excercise.
  - Final scoring.  Doable, maybe.
